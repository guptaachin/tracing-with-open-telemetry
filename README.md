## Distributed Tracing with OTel Collector, and Jaeger

### 1. Overview
Distributed tracing is essential for understanding the flow of requests across microservices in a complex system. In this guide, we'll set up a tracing pipeline using eBPF, the OpenTelemetry Collector (OTel Collector), and Jaeger.

### 2. Components
- **PingAckAPI**:
  - Is a light weight `net/http` API
  - Exposes `/ping` and /`delay` 
  - Also has Swagger integrated for easy
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**:
  - Collects, processes, and exports telemetry data (including traces).
  - Acts as an intermediary between eBPF and Jaeger.
- **Jaeger**:
  - Distributed tracing system for visualizing and analyzing trace data.
